**BI Project - Crime Data Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing crime data from Chicago to uncover patterns and insights related to criminal activity. We started by defining the business problem, which was to identify crime hotspots and trends to help improve public safety efforts. The project involved cleaning and transforming raw data to ensure its quality and consistency before loading it into a Data Warehouse. We chose the Star Schema for our Data Warehouse design to optimize querying and reporting.

Using the ETL process, we extracted crime data from multiple sources, applied necessary transformations (such as data cleaning, formatting, and enrichment), and loaded it into the Data Warehouse. We then created several SQL queries to analyze crime trends, such as the frequency of crimes by type, location, and time. Our analysis helped in identifying key patterns in crime occurrence, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation for law enforcement.

The final output of the project was a set of insightful queries and a comprehensive Data Warehouse structure that supports ongoing analysis of crime trends in Chicago.
